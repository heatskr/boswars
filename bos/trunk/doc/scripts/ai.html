<h2>Intro - Introduction to AI functions and variables</h2>

Everything around the control of the Stratagus AI.

<p>
Warning: The AI documentation is slightly outdated. This documentation hasn't 
been fully converted to the lua API yet.
<p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

AI in Stratagus is script based. Each AI player keeps executing scripts.
There are two kinds of scripts : 
<ul>
  <li>The main script. It starts buildings, ...</li>
  <li>The action/reaction scripts. They are started by the AI engine, under certain condition.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Scripts can arrange and control units using forces : <br>
A script can ask for some type of unit in a force (using <a href="#AiForce">AiForce</a>), 
and then wait for them to be ready (using <a href="#AiWaitForce">AiWaitForce</a>).<br>
<br>
<br>
The force 0 is a special case : it holds all the unassigned units, and is used to fill other forces. 
( when needed, units are transfered from force 0 to others ). Attacker units in force 0 won't be used for attacks<br>
Forces from 1 to 3 are also special : They are used as the attack reserve. 
Attack forces will only be created using units available in those forces.<br>
<br>
The main script is responsible for setting minimums for the forces 0 and 1. This will influence the balance
between defend and attack for an AI player.<br>
<br>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<a name="DefineAi"></a>
<h3>DefineAi(name, class, script)</h3>

This defines how a special AI works. Each level can use his own AI definition.

<dl>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>
Unique name of this AI definitions.  The "ai-type" parameter
of <a href="#DefineAiPlayer">DefineAiPlayer</a> refers to this.
</dd>
<dt>class</dt>
<dd>Class name of this definition. Used to choose the AI for computer players.
The map setup file sets e.g. <code>Players[1].AiName = "ai-blitz"</code>
and the engine then finds the AI type whose class name is that string.
This is also used in the "ai-name" parameter of
<a href="game.html#Player">Player</a>.
</dd>
<dt>script</dt>
<dd>A lua function.<p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Defines the passive computer AI, which does nothing.
DefineAi("passive-ai", "passive", function() AiSleep(10000) end)
</pre>

<a name="DefineAiHelper"></a>
<h3>DefineAiHelper(list)</h3>

The AI is complete configurable, nothing is hardcoded. The AI knows nothing
about any units without this table. This table defines F.E. what unit can build
and what they can build and many other things that the AI must know.


<dl>
<dt>list</dt>
<dd>A list of features:
 <ul>
 <li><code>{"build", "builder", "building-1", ... "building-n"}</code>
  <dl>
  <dt>builder</dt>
  <dd>Name of the unit-type that can build.
  </dd>
  <dt>building-1</dt>
  <dt>building-n</dt>
  <dd>Names of the unit-types that can be builded by the builder.
  </dd>
  </dl>
  <b>Note:</b> If more units can build the same buildings you need the same list
	for all units.
 <li><code>{"train", "trainer", "unit-1", ... "unit-n"}</code>
  <dl>
  <dt>trainer</dt>
  <dd>Name of the unit-type that can train the units.
  </dd>
  <dt>unit-1</dt>
  <dt>unit-n</dt>
  <dd>Names of the unit-types that can be trained by the trainer.
  </dd>
  </dl>
  <b>Note:</b> If more units can train the same unit you need the same list
	for all units.
 <li><code>{"repair", "worker", "unit-1", ... "unit-n"}</code>
  <dl>
  <dt>worker</dt>
  <dd>Name of the unit-type that can repair other units.
  </dd>
  <dt>unit-1</dt>
  <dt>unit-n</dt>
  <dd>Names of the unit-types that can be repaired by the worker.
  </dd>
  </dl>
  <b>Note:</b> If more units can repair the same units you need the same list
	for all units.
 <li><code>{"unit-equiv", "unit", "unit-1", ... "unit-n"}</code>
  <dl>
  <dt>unit</dt>
  <dd>Name of the unit-type that have equilvalent units.
  </dd>
  <dt>unit-1</dt>
  <dt>unit-n</dt>
  <dd>Names of the unit-types that can be uses by the AI equivalent.
  </dd>
  </dl>
 <li><code>{"unit-limit", "unit", "resource"}</code>
  <dl>
  <dt>unit</dt>
  <dd>Name of the unit-type that must be produced to reduce the unit limit.
  </dd>
  <dt>resource</dt>
  <dd>Name of the resource producing the shortage.
  </dd>
  </dl>
  <i>I think we should swap the arguments: "resource" "unit".</i>
 </ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

A minimal AI helper definition:

<pre>
DefineAiHelper(
  {"build", "unit-peasant", "unit-farm"},
  {"train", "unit-town-hall", "unit-peasant"},
  {"repair", "unit-peasant", "unit-town-hall"},
  {"unit-limit", "unit-farm", "food"},
  {"unit-equiv", "unit-town-hall", "unit-keep"})
</pre>

<p>A peasant can build a farm.
<p>The town hall can train a peasant.
<p>A peasant can repair the town hall.
<p>To fix the food shortage the AI must build farms.
<p>For the AI is a keep equivalent to a town hall.

<a name="DefineAiPlayer"></a>
<h3>DefineAiPlayer(player-number, properties)</h3>

Define an AI player. Saved games use this function;
map setup files should not.

No example is provided in this document because Lua scripts for maps
should not call DefineAiPlayer.

<a name="AiAttackWithForce"></a>
<h3>AiAttackWithForce(force)</h3>
 
Attack the opponent with the given force. The place is choosen by the AI. If there 	 
are flyers, ships and land units in the force they could attack different 	 
goals.

<dl> 	 
<dt>force</dt>
<dd>ID of the force to which the attacking units belong. The force ids 0 to 9
are currently supported.
</dd>
</dl>
 
<i>The force isn't moved as a single unit: faster units attacks first, than later the
slower units will attack.</i>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
   -- Force 0 is built with one assault unit. The script continues processing, when
   -- the assault unit is ready. When ready, the script attacks the opponent
   -- with force 0.
   {
     function() return AiForce(0, "unit-assault", 1) end,
     function() return AiWaitForce(0) end,
     function() return AiAttackWithForce(0) end
   }
</pre>

<a name="AiCheckForce"></a>
<h3>AiCheckForce(force)</h3>

Check if a force is ready.


<dl>
<dt>force</dt>
<dd>Number of the force to which the units should belong. 0 - 9 is currently
supported.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Force 0 is build with one footman. When the force is ready, sleep for
    -- 500 frames.
    AiForce(0, "unit-footman", 1)
    if (AiCheckForce(0)) then AiSleep(500) end
</pre>

<a name="AiDebug"></a>
<h3>AiDebug(flag)</h3>

<p><em>Obsolete since r5923 (2004-01-01):
    The debug flag no longer affects the engine,
    and scripts cannot read it.</em></p>

Enable or disable the debug output of the AI script execution.


<dl>
<dt>flag</dt>
<dd>If true enables printing of the AI commands, if false disables it.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Prints now the commands of this computer player.
    AiDebug(true)
</pre>

<a name="AiDebugPlayer"></a>
<h3>AiDebugPlayer(1, 2, 3, ...)</h3>

<p><em>Obsolete since r5923 (2004-01-01):
    The debug flag no longer affects the engine,
    and scripts cannot read it.</em></p>

Activate dump of AI forces and strategy on stdout.<br>
Parameters are player number, or "self", for thisplayer.<br>
"none" will stop all AI debug output.

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    AiDebugPlayer("self")
</pre>

<a name="AiForce"></a>
<h3>AiForce(force, unit-type-1, count-1, ... ,unit-type-N, count-N)</h3>

Define a force, what and how many units should belong to a force. Up to 10
forces are currently supported.
<br>
Force 0 is currently fixed to be the defence force. Send to a building or
unit under attack.
<br>
If there are any unassigned units of the requested unit-type, than they are
assigned to the force.
<br>
Note: The low-level didn't support the reduce of a force.


<dl>
<dt>force</dt>
<dd>Number of the force to which the units should belong. 0 - 9 is currently
supported.
</dd>
<dt>unit-type-1</dt>
<dt>unit-type-N</dt>
<dd>Unit-type that should be in the force. Currently only mobile (trained) units
are allowed.
</dd>
<dt>count-1</dt>
<dt>count-N</dt>
<dd>How many of this units should be in the force.
</dd>
</dl>

<i>The unit-types should be build in a fixed order. From left to right? or from
each unit-type one after the other?</i>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- First the force 0 is filled up with 4 footmans and 5 bowmans, after this
    -- force 1 is filled with 3 footmans and 2 bowmans.
    AiForce(0, "unit-footman", 4, "unit-bowman", 5)
    AiForce(1, "unit-footman", 3, "unit-bowman", 2)
</pre>

<a name="AiForceRole"></a>
<h3>AiForceRole(force, role)</h3>

<p><em>Obsolete since r5923 (2004-01-01):
    Roles of forces no longer affect the engine,
    and scripts cannot read them.</em></p>

Define the role of a force.


<dl>
<dt>force</dt>
<dd>Number of the force to which the units belong. 0 - 9 is currently
supported.
</dd>
<dt>role</dt>
<dd>The role of the force.  Can be either "attack" or "defend".
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Sets the role of force 0 to attack.
    AiForceRole(0, "attack")
</pre>

<a name="AiNeed"></a>
<h3>AiNeed(unit-type)</h3>

Tells the AI that it should have a unit of this unit-type. The AI builds or
trains units in this order of the AiSet/AiNeed commands. If the unit or an
equivalent unit already exists, the AI does nothing. If the unit is lost, it is
automatically rebuilt. If the units are requested in wrong order, the AI could 
hang up. Resources are collected automatic and farms are automatic build, but
additional could be requested.


<dl>
<dt>unit-type</dt>
<dd>Name of the unit-type required.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- The great hall must be build before a barrack.
  AiNeed("unit-great-hall")
  AiNeed("unit-barrack")
</pre>

<a name="AiPlayer"></a>
<h3>AiPlayer()</h3>

Return the player of the running AI.


<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Returns the player of the running AI.
    player = AiPlayer()
</pre>

<a name="AiSet"></a>
<h3>AiSet(unit-type, count)</h3>

This AiNeed with a number. Tells the AI that it should have a specified number
of a unit of this unit-type. The AI builds or trains units in this order of
the AiSet/AiNeed commands. If the unit or an equivalent unit already exists,
the AI does nothing. If the units are lost, they are automatic rebuild. If the
units are requested in wrong order, the AI could hang up. Resources are
collected automatic and farms are automatic build, but additional could be
requested. In the opposite to AiNeed, which always inserts a request, AiSet
modifies the last request to the new number.


<dl>
<dt>unit-type</dt>
<dd>Name of the unit-type(s) required.
</dd>
<dt>count</dt>
<dd>Number of unit-types(s) required.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    --  Request two assault units.
    AiSet("unit-assault", 2)
</pre>

<a name="AiSleep"></a>
<h3>AiSleep(frames)</h3>

Wait some frames, to let the opponent (you) recover.


<dl>
<dt>frames</dt>
<dd>How many frames (~1/30s) the AI shouldn't proceed with the script.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    {
      -- Wait 500 frames ~16s.
      function() return AiSleep(500) end,
    }
</pre>

<a name="AiWait"></a>
<h3>AiWait(type)</h3>

Waits until the *first* request of this unit-type is completed.
Don't forget to request a unit-type, before you wait on it.

<dl>
<dt>type</dt>
<dd>Wait for this unit type.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Proceed only if a peasant is ready.
    AiNeed("unit-peasant")
    AiWait("unit-peasant")
</pre>

<a name="AiWaitForce"></a>
<h3>AiWaitForce(force)</h3>

Wait until a force is complete, the forces are build in force number order.
First 0, than 1, last 9.


<dl>
<dt>force</dt>
<dd>Number of the force to which the units should belong. 0 - 9 is currently
supported.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Force 0 is build with one footman. The script continues processing, if the
    -- footman is ready trained.
    AiForce(0, "unit-footman", 1)
    AiWaitForce(0)
</pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>

The current AI script support is very limited, many new functions are needed.
If you want to write this you know who to contact.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre>
DefineAi("wc2-example", "land-attack",
 function()
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
This is the AI "wc2-example" usable for land-attack.
</p><pre>
     AiNeed("unit-great-hall")
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
The first need unit is the great-hall.
</p><pre>
     AiNeed("unit-peon")
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
The next unit should be the peon.
</p><pre>
     AiWait("unit-great-hall")
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
Now wait until the great hall is available. Could hang if no great hall can be
build.
</p><pre>
     AiWait("unit-peon")
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
Now wait unit we have a worker to build the next things.
</p>

FIXME: need some complex examples.
