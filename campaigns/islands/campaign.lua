   "you've been reassigned. Your first mission is to sabotage "..
   "the enemy's air base on Red Island. "..
   "Though small and relatively undefended, the base has proven "..
   "to be a problem for our forces. "..

   "Your second assignment is another relatively easy sabotage "..
   "mission. You've been given an elite sabotage team to "..
   "eliminate all enemy forces on Grendi Island, so our forces can "..
   "begin harvesting  resources from the resource rich island. "..

   "men you need to train your own troops for this assault. "..

   "The island's commander, your old rival Commander Petch, is  "..

   "The invasion of Korla was a resounding success, and now we can "..

   "Your fourth assignment is to conquer Aether island, a large base "..
   "supporting the enemy on the main islands. You now have control "..

   "Taking Triton Island is going to be a big operation, "..
   "but it is imperative. The south side of the island has several "..
   "cannon emplacements that are blocking our boats from reaching "..
   "Vespollan, and so they must be eliminated. Because of Triton's "..

   "they reach Korla again. Their invasion must be stopped, but we "..

   "of the island, and capturing that will end the war at last, "..

   "In particular, our best leader, Commander Willis, was captured "..
   "and killed. A small group of his men are all that remain. "..
   "They are being held in a POW camp, and it's up to you to "..
