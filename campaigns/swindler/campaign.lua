 "And they have a strong army..."

 "The Tubbies are decimated and will leave you alone for now.\n"..
 "You reached the waterside. You better build some defenses, since "..
 "there are some places where you can cross the water, and nobody knows "..
 "who lives across this rough terrain...\n"..
 "Or maybe you should plan a surprise attack?"
