<h1>Bos Wars Palette Documentation</h1>
<hr>

Bos Wars graphics use a 256 color palette.<p>

To see color indices, open the 'Indexed Palette' dialog in gimp.<p>

Some colors are fixed for specific usage as follows:<p>

<ul>
    <li>208-211 : These are the player colors, going from lightest to
    darkest and will be replaced depending on the player color.
    <li>The remaining colors may be used as regular colors
</ul>
