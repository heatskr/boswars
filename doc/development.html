<h1>Development for Bos Wars</h1>
<hr>

This file should give you some information to help with development of Stratagus.<p>

<h2>IRC - Internet Relay Chat</h2>

You can try to meet other Bos Wars developers and users on the 
<a href="http://www.freenode.net/">FreeNode</a> IRC Network, in the
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/bos">#bos</a> channel.

<h2>Mailing list</h2>

If you want to help with development for Stratagus you should 
<a href="http://archives.seul.org/bos/dev/">join</a>

<h2>Building Bos Wars</h2>

<h3>Installing the Subversion client</h3>

If you want to help develop, you should use Subversion. 
The online book <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with
Subversion</a> will help you master Subversion.

<h3>Getting Bos Wars from Subversion</h3>

<h4>The subversion repository of Bos Wars has two main directories:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>bos - The Bos Wars sources<p>
	The source to the Stratagus engine. The source is licenced
	under the GNU General Public License.
	<b>This contains the sources needed for development.</b>

    <li>htdocs - The Bos Wars Website<p>
	The website is stored in subversion for easy updating and version management
	by multiple people.  This module is not needed unless you plan to update
	the website 
</ul>

<h4>The bos directory is itself divided into 3 subdirectories:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>trunk - The main development branch. 
        Almost all activity happens in this directory.
    <li>branches - Special development branches.
    <li>tags - Snapshots of the code of special interest like releases. 
</ul>

<h4>How do I get the latest source code of Bos Wars?</h4>

For example:<p>
<pre>
  svn://bos.seul.org/svn/bos/bos/trunk
</pre>
<p>

This is done only once. To update your working copy, go into 
the directory and type 'svn up'.<p>

<h3>Getting Bos Warss without Subversion</h3>

Only releases are made outside of Subversion.  If you wish to be involved with
development, you should obtain the sources via Subversion. 
Subversion usually remains quite stable and is easier
for you to keep up to date. Release versions of stratagus are available 
<a href="http://www.boswars.org/download.shtml">here</a>.

<h3>Building Bos Wars</h3>

You can find instructions for compiling Bos Wars at 
<a href="install.html">install.html</a>.<br>
Since you already have a copy of the source, you may skip 
ahead to step 2.

<h2>Source code documentation</h2>

The engine has tagged source documentation.<p>

You need either <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">DoxyGen</a> or 
<a href="http://www.zib.de/Visual/software/doc++/index.html">DOC++</a> 
to generate source code documentation.

<h3>Tags used in source code</h3>

We use the doc++ tags:<p>

Multi line source code documentation:<p>
/** ... */<p>

Single line source code documentation:<p>
/// ... <p>

Start grouping:<p>
//@{ or /*@{*/<p>

End grouping:<p>
//@} or /*@}*/<p>


<ul>
    <li>@name
    <br>Name of file or group.
    <li>@param
    <br>Describes function/macro parameter
    <li>@return
    <br>Describes function return
    <li>@see
    <br>Links to other section
</ul><p>

Please read the doxygen/doc++ documentation.

<h2>Sending a patch</h2>

Once you have completed some work, you will probably want it to be 
included in the main Bos Wars source.<p>

Follow these steps:<p>
<ul>
    <li>svn up
    <li>svn diff &gt; your-nickname.diff
    <li>upload 'your-nickname.diff' to the 
    <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=stratagus-bos">patch tracker</a>.
</ul>
