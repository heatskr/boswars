<h1>FAQ for Bos Wars</h1>
<hr>

    <b>Q: .depend:1: *** missing separator.  Stop.</b><br>
    A: The .depend file is broken, simply 'rm .depend' and 'make depend' 
    again. If the problem still occurs, you will need to 'make' without 
    making dependencies first.<p>

    <b>Q: Does Bos Wars work with ALSA?</b><br>
    A: Yes, if you compiled SDL with ALSA support.<p>

    <b>Q: What ports does the Bos Wars network protocol use?</b><br>
    A: Bos Wars uses UDP with port 6660 by default, you may start boswars 
    with '-Pxxxx' flag to use port xxxx instead.<p>

    <b>Q: Does Bos Wars support internet/metaserver play?</b><br>
    A: Not yet, but this is a planned feature.<p>

    <b>Q: Bos Wars runs really slow in large resolutions, what can I do?</b><br>
    A: The engine has to update the whole screen every frame.
    Use OpenGL or play with a smaller screen resolution.<p>

    <b>Q: My question isn't answered here.</b><br>
    A: Ask your question on IRC #bos on freenode.org.<p>
