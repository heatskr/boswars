<h1>FAQ for Bos Wars</h1>
<hr>

    <b>Q: Does Bos Wars work with ALSA?</b><br>
    A: Yes, if you compiled SDL with ALSA support.<p>

    <b>Q: Does Bos Wars support LAN/Internet play?</b><br>
    A: Yes.<p>

    <b>Q: How do I play multiplayer?</b><br>
    A: Find the hostname or the IP address of someone you want to play with and connect to him.<p>

    <b>Q: What ports does the Bos Wars network protocol use?</b><br>
    A: Bos Wars uses UDP with port 6660 by default, you may start boswars 
    with '-Pxxxx' flag to use port xxxx instead.<p>

    <b>Q: Does Bos Wars support a game server, meta server, lobby or 
          anything like that ?</b><br>
    A: Not yet, but this is a planned feature.<p>
    
    <b>Q: How can I get the group keys to work on a non-us keyboard?</b><br>
    A: In "~/.boswars/preferences.lua", replace the digits in
    <i>GroupKeys = "0123456789"</i> by the characters output by
    hitting the digit keys of your keyboard without holding the shift key
    down. 
    Characters which are not ANSI 7 bit need to be encoded with their UTF-8 
    character code.<p>

    <b>Q: Bos Wars runs really slow in large resolutions, what can I do?</b><br>
    A: The engine has to update the whole screen every frame.
    Use OpenGL or play with a smaller screen resolution.<p>

    <b>Q: What should I do if my question isn't answered here?</b><br>
    A: Read the included documentation and look in the FAQ on our 
    <a href="http://www.boswars.org/wiki/index.php/Bos/FAQ">wiki</a>.
    If after that you still haven't found an answer to your question, 
    ask on our mailing list or on our IRC channel.<p>
